          product_description: ['Solvent inks are pigment-based like aqueous inks, but the difference lies in their carrier. Instead of water, solvent inks use volatile organic compounds - known as solvents. These inks are less expensive, and can be used on uncoated substrates such as vinyl, for printing adhesive decals, billboards, and banners used in outdoor displays. In fact, solvent inks work much better on plastic than paper or canvas. This is because non-polar inks (like solvents) adhere better to non-polar surfaces (like plastic). Though the printed color is not as strong as aqueous inks, solvent-based inks are generally safe from water and UV light. The hardy weather-resistant print that results makes them the ideal ink for large, outdoor presentations. Negatives of this type of ink are: the ventilation needed during printing and drying due to the dangerous fumes of the solvent, and their inflexibility when it comes to different substrates.'],

        product_description: ['Varnish is basically clear ink and can be gloss, satin or matte. A flood varnish covers the entire printed page for protection or sheen. A spot varnish allows you to highlight specific areas of a printed piece and adds shine and depth to specific elements on the page such as a logo or image. Varnishes are also applied on-press, but they are heavier-bodied and can be applied (like inks) to only certain areas (spot varnish). A press plate must be created to apply a spot varnish, so artwork that clearly defines where to apply it is necessary.'],

But there are some limitations to the specific colors that CMYK inks can create.', 'Spot Colors-In offset printing, spot colors are solid colors created using a specific premixed ink, usually based on Pantone Matching System (PMS) colors. Pantone colors are standardized, and each one is assigned an individual number and name, which designers and printers in different locations can use to easily identify the same exact color. Spot colors are bold and vibrant, but if you’re offset printing your design, the printer will probably charge you more for the job. '],
